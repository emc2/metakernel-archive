			Kernel Compilation Parameters

ARCH: The architecture for which to compile the kernel.

MULTITHREAD: Causes a multithreaded kernel to be generated.
Multithreaded kernels run on SMP architectures.  They have
spinlock-based synchronization primitives, cpu-specific data,
interprocessor interrupt stuff, and most importantly, a much more
complicated scheduler.

PAGE_COLOR: Causes the kernel to use a cache-colored page allocation
scheme instead of blind allocation.  This increases the running time
of page allocation from O(n) = k to O(n) = log(n), but should reduce
cache misses.

SCHED_SPECIAL_MODES: Causes the scheduler to support NO_RESCHED,
EXCLUSIVE, and ATOMIC modes.  This drastically increased the
complexity of the scheduler, and even worse, requires the use of
syncronization in EVERY SINGLE run of the scheduler...

FPU_DELAYED_SWITCH: On architectures that support it, allows the
kernel to delay switching of floating-point state during a context
switch.

NULL_FILESYS_OPS: Allows creation of files without a filesystem
backing them (inode zero specified as their backing store).
Obviously, they do not survive a reboot.  Use this to implement easy
pipes, message queues, and temp files...

OFFSET_64: Forces all offsets to be 64 bits.  This may become required.

NO_SWAP: Causes all swap code to be omitted from the kernel.
